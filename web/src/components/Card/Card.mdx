# Card Component

<Canvas of={CardStories.Default} />

The `Card` component is a reusable component that represents a card with a title, description, and an icon. It is commonly used in UI designs to display information in a visually appealing manner.

## Usage

To use the `Card` component, follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary dependencies and the `Card` component into your project.
2. Render the `Card` component and pass the required props.

Example usage:

```jsx
import Card from './Card';

function App() {
  return (
    <Card index={0} title="Title" description="Description" Icon={/* Your icon component */} />
  );
}
```

## Props

The `Card` component accepts the following props:

- `index` (number, required): The index or identifier of the card.
- `title` (string, required): The title of the card.
- `description` (string, required): The description or content of the card.
- `Icon` (Icon component, required): An icon component to be displayed on the card. It can be any valid React component that renders an icon.

## Styling

The `Card` component applies the following default styles:

- A background color of `zinc-100`.
- Padding of `6` on all sides.
- A rounded border with a radius of `lg`.
- A minimum width of `20rem`.
- Text color classes: `text-dark-green-700` for the icon, `text-black` for the title, and `text-zinc-600` for the description.

You can customize the styles by modifying the CSS classes or using CSS-in-JS techniques.

## Dependencies

Make sure to install the following dependencies for the `Card` component to work correctly:

- `@phosphor-icons/react`: This package provides the icons used in the component.
- `next/font-google`: This package provides the Sora font, which is used for the title text.

## Example

Here's an example of using the `Card` component with a `SealCheck` icon:

```jsx
import Card from './Card';
import { SealCheck } from '@phosphor-icons/react';

function App() {
  return (
    <Card index={0} title="Title" description="Description" Icon={SealCheck} />
  );
}
```

In this example, the component is rendered with an index of `0`, a title of `"Title"`, a description of `"Description"`, and the `SealCheck` icon.

That's all about the `Card` component. You can now use it in your React project to create stylish and informative cards with ease.

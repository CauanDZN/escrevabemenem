The `SlideCarousel` component is a React carousel component that allows you to slide through a list of child elements. It provides features such as automatic sliding, dragging to navigate, and touch support for mobile devices.

## Usage

To use the `SlideCarousel` component, follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary dependencies and the `SlideCarousel` component into your project.
2. Render the `SlideCarousel` component and pass the required props.

Example usage:

```jsx
import SlideCarousel from './SlideCarousel';

function App() {
  return (
    <SlideCarousel />
  );
}
```

## Props

The `SlideCarousel` component accepts the following props:

- `className` (string, required): A CSS class name to apply to the component's container div.
- `children` (ReactElement[], required): An array of React elements representing the slides in the carousel.

## Functionality

The `SlideCarousel` component provides the following functionality:

- Automatic Sliding: The component automatically transitions to the next slide after a specified interval (default: 5 seconds). The interval can be customized by modifying the `useEffect` hook in the component code.
- Manual Navigation: You can navigate between slides by clicking the previous and next buttons or by clicking the indicator dots below the slides.
- Dragging Support: You can drag the carousel horizontally to navigate between slides. Click and hold on the carousel, then move the cursor left or right to slide.
- Touch Support: The component also supports touch gestures for navigation on mobile devices. Swipe left or right on the carousel to slide between elements.

## Dependencies

Make sure to install the following dependencies for the `SlideCarousel` component to work correctly:

- `@phosphor-icons/react`: This package provides the caret icons used for the previous and next buttons in the carousel.
- `react`: The React library.
- `react-dom`: The React DOM library.

## Example

Here's an example of using the `SlideCarousel` component with three slides:

```jsx
import SlideCarousel from './SlideCarousel';

function App() {
  return (
    <SlideCarousel className="your-custom-tailwind">
      <div className="h-[100%] min-w-[100%] bg-zinc-300 border border-zinc-400 flex flex-row justify-center items-center">Slide 1</div>
      <div className="h-[100%] min-w-[100%] bg-zinc-300 border border-zinc-400 flex flex-row justify-center items-center">Slide 2</div>
      <div className="h-[100%] min-w-[100%] bg-zinc-300 border border-zinc-400 flex flex-row justify-center items-center">Slide 3</div>
    </SlideCarousel>
  );
}
```

In this example, the component is rendered with a custom CSS class name and three slide elements.
